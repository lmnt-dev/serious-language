title: Chinese Flashcards | Serious Language Student
---

## Serious Language Student flashcards offer you the following:

- users are methodically introduced to 1000+ words of common Chinese vocabulary.

- progress through the vocabulary is personalized to the user. As the user responds to a flashcard
successfully, that card is prevented less frequently. If the user needs to review that card, it is
presented more frequently. The formula on which the frequency of card repetition is based flows
from research on effective learning curves.

- words are introduced
    - first from Chinese in 拼音 (pīnyīn) to English, e.g., shuǐ to "water,"
    - then from English to Chinese in 拼音 (pīnyīn), e.g., "water" to shuǐ,
    - then 汉字 (hànzì) to 拼音 (pīnyīn) and English, e.g. 水 to shuǐ and "water,"
    - then finally English to 汉字 (hànzì) and 拼音 (pīnyīn), e.g., "water" to 水 to shuǐ.
    - (Compare whether other products practice all four possibilities.)

- practice is never multiple choice. Understanding, speaking, and reading Chinese are not multiple
choice tasks.
(Check whether other products use multiple choice.)

- users can override the order in which new vocabulary is introduced in order to adapt to the order of
vocabulary introduction of any teacher or textbook.
(Compare whether other products have this adaptability.)

- users can combine a teacher or textbook's order of introducing new words with the order in which
Serious Language Student introduces them by allowing Serious Language Student methodically
to expand beyond the teacher or textbook, if the teacher or textbook words are being mastered
well.

- users who are coordinating use of Serious Language Student flashcards with a language course can
set Serious Language Student to quiz mode in order to drill a certain set of words with no
expansion of vocabulary but staying with the drill of only those words. After the drill or test
Serious Language Student can be toggled back to gradual vocabulary expansion.
(Compare whether other products have this quiz concentration option.)

- users can add vocabulary words in addition to the 1000+ words with which Serious Language Student
comes supplied. Thus, users with a teacher or textbook or users reading on their own can add to
the vocabulary list all the vocabulary introduced by that teacher or textbook or interesting words
encountered in reading. Users then practice all that new vocabulary as part of the Serious
Language Student practice.
(The ability to add words to the vocabulary corpus appears to be unique to Serious Language
Student.)

- users practice writing 汉字 (hànzì) in that they practice describing characters, using the same method
as Chinese themselves use. If users can describe a character, then they can envision it and
know how to write it.
(Compare whether other products practice this kind of active knowledge of characters.)

- the correct tone is treated as an essential part of the word, as important as its initial or its ending. The
Chinese word for "big" is dà, not da. As the name implies the Serious Language Student is a
serious student.
(Compare whether other products adequately recognize the importance of the correct tone, going
both from Chinese to English and from English to Chinese.)
