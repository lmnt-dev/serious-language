## Added Cards: How does one add a card?

In order to add a card, one first writes down the word in 拼 音 (pīnyīn) and checks to see whether it is already among the Serious Language Student cards. In order to do that checking, one opens the program and clicks [ ⚙ Settings ], which takes one to the Settings page. Under Question 2, one checks any option other than Standard Mode. (If one prefers to be in Standard Mode, one must come back later and change back to that mode.) One clicks on [OK], which takes one to a screen that prompts one to provide a word. Using 拼 音 (pīnyīn), one types into the box the word one wants to add and clicks on [OK]. If the word is already among Serious Language Student cards, it will be shown, and one only needs to click on [Yes].

However, if one is not shown the desired word, one clicks [No] and then clicks on the option [I will supply]. In order to supply it oneself, one will need (a) to have written down all the English translations one wants to have accepted, (2) to have found the Unicode number(s) for the 汉字 (hànzì) with which the word is written, and (3) to have found the radical number plus the number of additional strokes for each such 汉字 (hànzì).

(Those who are unfamiliar with Unicode may want to visit the Unicode web site at https://unicode.org/charts/ and particularly the pages showing the CJK (Chinese Japanese Korean) ideographs, whose Unicode numbers are 4E00 through 9FFF. Note that Unicode numbers are 4 digit hexadecimal numbers, i.e., they are written with the 10 digits 0 through 9 and the six letters A through F.)

There are a variety of ways to determine the Unicode number of a 汉字 (hànzì). Many print dictionaries now include that information. If the user has access to software that allows the writing of 汉字 (hànzì), then a 汉字 (hànzì) can be copied and pasted into the search window of most browsers, and a search will usually find a web page about that 汉字 (hànzì) that includes its Unicode number. The user may also find useful the software Unitype Global Writer http://www.unitype.com/globalwriter.php, which allows one to type Chinese in 拼 音 (pīnyīn), with or without tones, and one then sees the 汉字 (hànzì) with, optionally, the corresponding Unicode. Also useful is the Wiktionary web site (https://en.wiktionary.org/), which can lead one to the Unicode number for any 汉字 (hànzì).

The best source for finding the radical number and the number of additional strokes is, again, the Wiktionary web site, although other sources will have the same information. The original 康 熙  (kāngxī) dictionary is available online at a variety of sites, some of them more accessible to foreign learners than others.

If one has the English translations, the Unicode number(s), and the radical plus additional stroke count assignments, one simply follows the prompts after clicking on [I will supply.]

## Added Cards: Why is an added card not being tested? 

When the user adds a card, the Serious Language Student adds it first to its list of words to be tested translating from Chinese in 拼 音 (pīnyīn) to English. If other words on that list are overdue to be tested, then the user's added word may not be seen immediately, i.e., not until those words with earlier due dates have appeared.

If the user wants to add a card or cards and then be tested only on that card or those cards, the user can choose Quiz Mode, which can be chosen on the Settings page.

## Deleting Cards: How does one delete a card? 

Cards which the user has added can be deleted. This is particularly useful when a mistake has been made, in which case the card with the mistake can be deleted and then a correct, replacement card can be added. (Cards provided by the Serious Language Student cannot be deleted.)

In order to delete a card, one takes the following steps:

- from any screen which shows the [ ⚙ Settings ] button, one clicks on it.
- on the resulting screen one checks (or leaves checked) any mode other than Standard Mode and hits [ENTER] or clicks on [OK]. (If one prefers to be in Standard Mode, one must come back later and change back to that mode.)
- The next screen allows the user to enter a new word. One enters in 拼 音 (pīnyīn) the word one wants to delete. (Be sure that what one enters is exactly the same as what is on the card one wants to delete, including the tones.) One then hits [ENTER] or clicks on [OK].
- Serious Language Student may then show one or more cards from the original vocabulary or words that the user has added that are not to be deleted. In each such case, the user simply clicks on [NO].
- Eventually, Serious Language Student will offer the word to be deleted. Since it is a user added word, there will be a button for deleting it. One clicks on this delete button. The card will be deleted.

Note well! In order to delete the word from all records, Serious Language Student will close. Assuming the user wants to continue practicing, the program must be restarted.

## New Cards: How rapidly does the Serious Language Student introduce new cards? 

The Serious Language Student introduces new cards according to a formula that is a trade secret, but which depends on the success the user is having. If the user is replying correctly to many of the words already seen, a new card is introduced sooner. If the user is not yet having complete sucess with the cards already seen, new cards are postponed.

However, the user can have some influence on how fast new cards are presented. On the Settings screen, the user should look at the response to Question 3, the number of new cards to be introduced at one time. If this number is low (the minimum allowed is 5), new cards are introduced more slowly. If this number is high (the maximum allowed is 30), new cards are introduced more rapidly.

## Parenthetical Information: Can the parenthetical part of a definition be omitted?

Yes. In fact, it is better to omit it. It is included only to give the user a better sense of the word or to distinguish the word from other words. Also, the parenthetical information is important going from English to Chinese in order to specify the Chinese word wanted. Going from Chinese to English, if users do want to include the parenthetical information in their answer, they must do so precisely as it appears, i.e., with the parentheses and with the spacing as shown on the card.

## Particles: What is a particle?

There is a small number of Chinese words that have a primarily grammatical function and that do not lend themselves to translation by themselves. Examples which should be familiar even to beginning students of Chinese are 的  (de), which is used to make adjectival constructions, and 吗 (ma), which is used to mark a yes / no question. (Note that most of these particles are neutral tone.) Since these words do not have a natural translation in isolation, the Serious Language Student simply labels them "particles," and when one is going from Chinese to English, the English box can simply be filled by "particle." However, when one is translating from English to Chinese, "particle" by itself would obviousy not suffice as a prompt, and the user must pay attention to the parenthetical information to know which particle is desired, e.g., "particle (forming adjectival)" is the prompt for 的  (de) and "particle (question)" is the prompt for 吗 (ma). When translating from Chinese to English, the parenthetical information can be, and probably should be, omitted.

## Pīnyīn: How to type 拼 音 (pīnyīn).

The tones are typed using their traditional numbers, e.g., 1 for the high level tone, etc. Thus 北  京  (beǐjīng) is typed b-e-3-i-j-i-1-n-g. Diaresis (") is typed using the quotation mark. Thus 女  (nǚ) is typed either n-u-"-3 or n-u-3-". Tones are added immediately after the vowel above which they appear, not at the end of the syllable.

## Radicals: How does the Serious Language Student describe characters? 

The Serious Language Student uses the traditional system of describing characters by so-called radicals and additional strokes. (Depending on how the user has learned Chinese and Chinese grammar, the following information may be familiar and quickly scanned.) To understand the system, consider the example, 杉  (shān) "fir." It is composed of what is called the "radical" 木　on the left plus three additional strokes on the right. Similarly, 枯 (kū) "dry, withered," is composed of the same radical 木　on the left plus five additional strokes on the right. Of course, the radical by itself is also a word, 木 (mù) "tree." The Chinese word for "radical" in this sense is 部 首 (bùshǒu).

The second example illustrates the system that can be seen in many characters. The five strokes on the right are the character 古 (gǔ) "old." Thus, if a Chinese speaker tries to think of a word associated with trees and sounding like gǔ and in this case having something to do with being old, one thinks of kū "dry, withered," so that must be the word for which this is the character. The logic of sounds depends, of course, on the region, the dialect and the era when the character was created and became standard, and so many of the sound related aspects of the system are lost in modern Mandarin.

On each of the Serious Language Student's flashcards is given for each character its radical and its additional number of strokes according to this system. As much as possible, the assignment of the radical and the number of additional strokes follows the 1615 康 熙 (kāngxī) dictionary from the Ming dynasty. See "Radicals: What list of radicals does the Serious Language Student use?" below.

## Radicals: Nicknames 

It is not necessary for the user to remember the numbers of the radicals. To save time it is easier and faster to use their nicknames. Each radical has a Chinese nickname and an English nickname.

In general, the Chinese nickname is simply the word for which the character stands. Thus radical 30, 口 , is nicknamed "kǒu" and its English nickname is "mouth." 

Where two radicals are pronounced the same, their Chinese nicknames are distinguished by adding the stroke count to the nickname of any radical later in the list with the same pronunciation. Thus, radical 16,  几, is nicknamed "jǐ," but radical 49, 己 , is nicknamed "jǐ 3," 49 being later in the list than 16. To help the user remember which radical does not need its stroke count as part of its nickname, the first radical among several sharing the same name will as a rule have the smallest stroke count. For example radical 24, 十 , radical 112, 石 , and radical 184, 食 , are all pronounced shí. Radical 24, 十 , the first among the three with only two strokes has the simple nickname "shí." The higher stroke radicals have the nicknames "shí 5" for radical 112, 石 , and "shí 9" for radical 184, 食 .

Where two radicals traditionally have the same or similar English nicknames, again stroke count is used. Thus, radical 49, 己 , has the English nickname "self," but the later radical 132, 自 , has the English nickname "self 6." 

Any time one wishes to view the Chinese and English nicknames of radicals, one can use the [List] button on any screen that is asking the user to write Chinese.

## Radicals: Visually identical radicals. 

Before reading the answer to this question, the user should be familiar with the information in "Radicals: which part of a character is the radical?" 

At least three pairs of radicals are indistinguishable in hand writing and almost indistinguishable in print. These pairs are:

- (i) 月, which as a character component can be either 130 肉  (ròu) "meat" or 74 月  (yuè) "moon"; 
- (ii) 土, which as a character component can be either 32 土  (tǔ) "earth" or 33 士  (shì) "scholar"; and 
- (iii) 日 , which as a character component can be either 72 日  (rì) "sun" or 73 曰  (yuē) "say."

Modern Chinese dictionaries resolve this difficulty in different ways. Many, for example, will assign any character which has the component 月 to radical 74 (yuè) "moon," even though some of those characters were traditinally assigned to 130 (ròu) "meat." The Serious Language Student seeks conformity and truth to tradition by following the 康 熙 kāngxī dictionary assignments. When first viewing a flashcard, the user should carefully note to which of these ambiguous radicals the character is assigned. In many cases, the meaning of the character will be a hint to the assignment. For example, if a character's radical is 月 and the meaning has to do with a body part, then the radical probably is 130 肉  (ròu) "meat," whereas if the meaning is a season or a time of day, then the radical is probably 74 月  (yuè) "moon."

## Radicals: What list of radicals does the serious language student use?

The Serious Language Student uses the traditional list of 214 radicals, the so-called 康 熙 (kāngxī) list. This 214 radical list was the one used in China in the Ming Dynasty dictionary of 1615, i.e., over 400 years ago. It is part of the common heritage not only of China, both in the People’s Republic and in Taiwan, but also in Japan, Korea, and Viet Nam. Wherever Chinese characters are part of the history or the modern culture of a country, the 214  康 熙 (kāngxī) radicals are known and constitute the shared, traditional list. 

Outside the People's Republic the  康 熙  (kāngxī) list is essentially the only list used. In the People's Republic, however, a great variety of lists are used. The difficulty is that no such new list has become the standard; essentially every dictionary one picks up, whether intended for use by Chinese or use by foreigners, has its own list. The lack of any one modern standard led the Serious Language Student to stay with the 康 熙  (kāngxī) list, despite its drawbacks. Given a familiarity with the  康 熙  (kāngxī) list and its use, foreign students can quickly adapt to whatever modifications of that list is being used in any reference works they encounter, with the benefit that any such list will difer from the 康 熙  (kāngxī) list in the direction of ease and simplification of use.

## Radicals: Which Part of a Character is the Radical?

As much as possible, the Serious Language Student follows the radical assignments of the Ming dynasty  康 熙  (kāngxī) dictionary of 1615. (See "Radicals: What list of radicals does the Serious Language Student use?") In almost all cases this assignment makes sense with relation to the meaning of the word, which facilitates remembering what part is the radical. Where the simplified character has lost the radical that was assigned by the  康  熙  (kāngxī) dictionary, the Serious Language Student chooses a radical on the left rather than one on the right and a radical on the top rather than one on the bottom. In all cases, the user can see on the flashcard, when it is first introduced and any time it is seen afterward, which radical is being used for that character.

## Radicals: Zero additional stroke characters

Two characters are both classified in the traditional 部首 (bùshǒu) system as radical 96 plus zero (0) additional strokes. One is the radical itself, 玉  (yù) "jade," and the other is 王 (wáng) "king."

Also, three very similar characters are all classified as radical 49 plus zero (0) additional strokes in the 部首 (bùshǒu) system. The first is the radical itself, 己  (jǐ)  "self." The second is 已 (yǐ) "already; to stop, to end, to cease." The third is 巳 (sì). This third word is an astrological term and refers to the late morning, the 4th solar month, and the year of the snake. Since 巳 (sì) is not common, it is not among the Serious Language Student's first thousand Chinese words, but the user does need to learn and to distinguish 己  ( jǐ)  "self" and 已  (yǐ) "already; to stop, to end, to cease," both of which are written as radical 49 plus zero strokes.

## Shortcuts: Initial "to"

The initial "to" of all verbs may be omitted.

## Shorcuts: Keyboard versus mouse

As much as possible, Serious Language Student has tried to configure its use in order to minimize the extent to which the user must go back and forth from keyboard to mouse and mouse to keyboard. The user will have to experiment to see the extent to which this goal has been achieved. One should note the following:

- As much as possible, when a new screen opens up requiring the user's input, the cursor is already at the appropriate entry box, and the user can simply begin typing.
- If the user needs to move from one input box to another, the [TAB] key usually moves the cursor to that next box.
- If the user wants to move back to a previous box, this can often by accomplished by the Shift [TAB] key.
- On many screens, clicking on an [OK] button can be replaced by hitting [RETURN].
- When describing a character, if the cursor is in any of the three boxes which (a) elicit the name or number of the radical or (b) the number of additional strokes or (c) the number of strokes in the radical in whch the user is interested, [ENTER] is the equivalent of clicking on the [WRITE] or [LIST] button.
- When choosing among a number of characters, all with the same radical and the same numer of additional strokes, rather than clicking on "none of the above," one can simply leave the choice box blank and hit [RETURN].
- Similarly, when choosing among a number of radicals, all with the same stroke count, rather than clicking on "none of the above," one can simply leave the choice box blank and hit [RETURN].

## Syllables: Monosyllabic words versus bisyllabic words.

In modern Chinese many bisyllabic words are used much more commonly that their monosyllabic synonyms. Thus 大 象 dàxiàng is much more common than 像  xiàng for "elephant," and 母 亲 mǔqīn is much more common than 妈 mā for "mother." Nonetheless the Serious Language Student often includes the monosyllabic word instead of or before the bisyllabic synonym in order to present a common multisyllabic component, or to illustrate a radical or for similar reasons. The user must learn from practice and context which of various synonyms is more common for a given meaning, and should be prepared for the fact that the monosyllable is often the less common choice and has an air of being literary or classical or old-fashioned.

## Tones in Multisyllabic words: 

- As the user should have learned, the tone with which a word is pronounced can be affected by context. For example, the common phrase 你 好 "Hello," is pronounced níhǎo, even though 你 "you" in isolation is pronounced nǐ. This is an example of the phenomenon of "sandhi," the linguist's term for the change in the form or pronunciation of a word depending on its context in an utterance. Consistent with most resources, the Serious Language Student does not reflect these changes in tones in its 拼 音 (pīnyīn) transcriptions of compound words. Thus, for example, 一 直 "straight" is transcribed yīzhí, even though as a result of sandhi it is actually pronounced yìzhí.
- However, a syllable's loss of tone in a compound, i.e., its being pronounced with neutral tone, cannot be predicted from the sandhi rules of Chinese. Therefore, so that the user may know when a syllable is pronounced in neutral tone, that fact is shown here by the syllable's being transcribed without a tone indication. Thus, 难, "difficult, hard" is pronounced nán with second tone, but in the two syllable word 困 难, "trouble, difficulty," the second syllable is pronounced with the neutral tone, so the word is transcribed here as kùnnan.

## Word Frequency: Are the words in the first box of the Serious Language Student’s flashcards the 1,000 most common words in Chinese?

Users need to recognize that there is no such collection of the 1,000 most common words in Chinese or in any living language. The most commons words will always depend on the underlying corpus. If one takes the vocabulary of English as an example, the 1,000 most common words used in "The New York Times" in 2017 will not be the same set as the 1,000 most common words of every day American speech, and the latter set will vary depending on whether one is talking about informal speech among friends or more formal speech in business and work settings. For one example, “get,” meaning “to obtain” or “to become” is probably among the 100 most common words of informal spoken American English, but well might not be used at all with those meanings in "The New York Times." Further, "The New York Times" versus informal speech versus formal speech are not the only three corpora one might consider. The vocabulary of current American fiction would be yet a different corpus, as would the vocabulary of scientific journals. 

The 1,000 words chosen for the Serious Language Student’s first box of flashcards reflect frequency studies of a variety of different corpora. However, because of the nature of the Chinese writing system, certain one syllable words were included, even when their inclusion was not completely justified by their frequency. For example, the radicals that occur in the words used by the Serious Language Student, to the extent that they are themselves words, are included, unless they are extremely uncommon. For example, both 刀 () "knife" and 禾 () "standing grain" are included, even though they are not particularly common, to facilitate the user's learning their use as radicals. Similarly, some not very common monosyllabic words are included, because they are used in very common multisyllabic words. Thus, for example, 持 (chí) "to hold, to maintain, to keep," although not so common, is included to facilitate the learning of such very common words as 支持 (zhīchí) "to support, to back up" and 坚持 (jiānchí) "to persist, to persevere."
