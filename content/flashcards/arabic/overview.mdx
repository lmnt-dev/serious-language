title: Arabic Flashcards | Serious Language Student
---

## Serious Language Student flashcards offer you the following:

- users are methodically introduced to 1000+ words of common Arabic
vocabulary.


- progress through the vocabulary is personalized to the user. As
the user responds to a flashcard successfully, that card is
presented less frequently. If the user needs to review that card,
it is presented more frequently. The formula on which the
frequency of card repetition is based flows from research on
effective learning curves.

- words are introduced
    - first going from Arabic to English e.g., ذَهَبَ to "to go",
    - then English to Arabic, e.g., "to go" to ذَهَبَ 

- practice is never multiple choice. Understanding, speaking, and
reading Arabic are not multiple choice tasks. (Check whether other
products use multiple choice.)

- users can override the order in which new vocabulary is introduced
in order to adapt to the order of vocabulary introduction of any
teacher or textbook. (Compare whether other products have this
adaptability.)

- users can combine a teacher or textbook's order of introducing new
words with the order in which Serious Language Student introduces
them by allowing Serious Language Student methodically to expand
beyond the teacher or textbook, if the teacher or textbook words
are being mastered well.

- users who are coordinating use of Serious Language Student
flashcards with a language course can set Serious Language Student
to quiz mode in order to drill a certain set of words with no
expansion of vocabulary but staying with the drill of only those
words. After the drill or test Serious Language Student can be
toggled back to gradual vocabulary expansion. (Compare whether
other products have this quiz concentration option.)

- users can add vocabulary words in addition to the 1000+ words with
which Serious Language Student comes supplied. Thus, users with a
teacher or textbook or users reading on their own can add to the
vocabulary list all the vocabulary introduced by that teacher or
textbook or interesting words encountered in reading. Users then
practice all that new vocabulary as part of the Serious Language
Student practice. (The ability to add words to the vocabulary
corpus appears to be unique to Serious Language Student.)

- users practice reading Arabic as they will see it in the Arabic
speaking world, i.e., without voweling. However, users will write
Arabic vocabulary with voweling to be sure that they know how the
words are pronounced, e.g., "to drink" 
is <span class="text-4xl">  شَرِبَ </span>, 
not<span class="text-4xl"> * سَرَبَ </span> 
or<span class="text-4xl">  *  شَرُبَ </span>.
(Compare whether other products handle voweling
correctly, both in reading Arabic and in writing Arabic.)

- grammar points needed to master vocabulary are included. Not only
is<span class="text-4xl">  هَرْبٌ </span> included 
meaning "war" or "warfare," but it is also
marked as feminine. Not only 
is<span class="text-4xl">  عَرَفَ </span>included meaning "to
know," "to recognize," or "to be aware of," 
but its present masculine 
singular,<span class="text-4xl">  يَعْرِفُ </span>, is also included, 
showing the correct vowel, kesra. 
Not only is<span class="text-4xl"> كَبيرٌ </span>, 
included, meaning "big" or "great," but its masculine
 plural,<span class="text-4xl"> كِبارٌ  </span>, ِis also included.
(Compare whether other products include complete grammatical
information about each word, and check whether they include
knowing that information as part of knowing that word.)
