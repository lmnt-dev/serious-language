## Added Cards: How does one add a card?

In order to add a card, one first writes down the word in Arabic with voweling and checks to see whether it is already among the Serious Language Student cards. In order to do that checking, one opens the program and clicks [ ⚙ Settings ], which takes one to the Settings page. Under Question 2, one checks any option other than Standard Mode. (If one prefers to be in Standard Mode, one must come back later and change back to that mode.)  One clicks on [OK], which takes one to a screen that prompts one to provide a word. One types into the box the word one wants to add, with complete voweling, and clicks on [OK]. If the word is already among Serious Language Student cards, it will be shown, and one only needs to click on [Yes].
However, if the desired word is not shown, one clicks [No] and then clicks on [I will supply]. In order to supply it oneself, one will need to decide whether it is a word for which one will need to supply one form, e.g., an adverb or other uninflected word, or two forms, e.g., a verb or a noun, or three forms, e.g., an adjective. 

Uninflected words are self-explanatory and easy to add. 

Two form words are either nouns or verbs. If the word is a noun, one needs to know its gender and its plural as well as its singular. If it is a verb, one needs to know its masculine singular present as well as its masculine singular past. One will need this information even if it is predictable, e.g., a noun ending in ةٌ- is feminine, or the present tense vowel of a Form IV verb is kesra.

Four form words are generally adjectives for which one needs to know masculine and feminine, singular and plural. As above, one needs to know and supply these forms, even if they are predictable.

If the word one types is not accepted with the message that the word is not completely voweled, one should note the following rules:

- The following keys are considered voweling: fatha, fathatan, kesra, kesratan, damma, dammatan, superscript alef or sukun.
- In general, every key stroke must be followed by a voweling, by alef, by yeh, by waw or by alef maksura.
- As an exception, the following key strokes need not be followed by a voweling: a voweling, alef, yeh, waw, alef maksura, hamzatu 'l wasla on an alef seat, madda on an alef seat, and hamza on an alef seat if the hamza is below the alef.

## Added Cards: Why is an added card not being tested?

When the user adds a card, the Serious Language Student adds it first to its list of words to be tested translating from Arabic to English. If other words on that list are overdue to be tested, then the user's added word may not be seen immediately, i.e., not until those words with earlier due dates have appeared.

If the user wants to add a card or cards and then be tested only on that card or those cards, the user can choose Quiz Mode, which can be chosen on the Settings page.

## Adjectives: Can an adjective be used as a noun?

As noted under “Plurals: Can a noun or adjective have more than one plural?” Arabic commonly uses adjectives standing alone as nouns, similarly to English use of “the rich” or “the wise.” In Arabic, unlike English, this usage can extend to the singular as well as the plural. In some cases, the meaning of the adjective when used as a noun is not immediately obvious to the English speaker. Where an adjective is commonly also used as a noun and the meaning is not immediate, the noun meaning is given as a translation of the adjective. For example, “official” and “employer” are given as translations of the adjective  مَسؤول, “responsible.”

## Adjectives: How many forms does an adjective have?

In general an Arabic adjective has four forms: masculine singular, masculine plural, feminine singular, and feminine plural. For example آخَرُ , آخَرونَ , أُخرى and أُخرَيات. The corresponding card tests all four forms. However, many adjectives have predictable feminine forms; the feminine singular ends in ة-, and the feminine plural is a sound plural ending in ات-. The corresponding card for adjectives of this type have entry boxes for the feminine singular and plural, but they may be left empty. Finally, some adjectives have no common masculine plural form, and the feminine forms are as above. The corresponding card for these adjectives has an entry box only for the masculine singular. The assignment of an adjective to this last category is based on the corresponding entry in Wehr. 

## Adjectives,  نِسبَة (nisba): Are they included?

In general nisba adjectives are not included as separate cards, since their meaning and their grammatical forms are easily deduced. They are omitted even when they are very common words. Thus وَطَنٌ, “nation, homeland” is included, and the very common corresponding nisba adjective, وَطَنيٌّ, “national,” is not included. An exception is sometimes made when the meaning of the nisba adjective can not immediately be deduced from the corresponding noun.

## Cognates: how does the Serious Language Student handle cognates?

Generally, cognates borrowed from Western languages are omitted, since students will immediately recognize and understand them, when hearing or reading them, and can easily learn how they are transcribed into Arabic, which may vary. E.g., ديمقراطيّة or ديموقراطيّة , "democracy.”

## Defectives: how does the Serious Language Student handle defectives?

So-called “defectives,” which may be either nouns or adjectives, have a citation form ending in /-in/, e.g., جارٍ (jarin). These result from a pattern where the final root is و (waw) or ي (yeh), and the preceding vowel is /i/. Since /jaariyun/ is not a possible sound sequence in Arabic, * جارِيٌ becomes جارٍ . Since the various resulting forms, singular and plural, definite and indefinite, masculine and feminine are treated in grammar textbooks, only the masculine, singular, indefinite is included here.

## Deleting Cards: How does one delete a card? 

Cards which the user has added can be deleted. This is particularly useful when a mistake has been made, in which case the card with the mistake can be deleted and then a correct, replacement card can be added. (Cards provided by the Serious Language Student cannot be deleted.)

In order to delete a card, one takes the following steps:

- from any screen which shows the [ ⚙ Settings ] button, one clicks on it.
- on the resulting screen one checks (or leaves checked) any mode other than Standard Mode and hits [ENTER] or clicks on [OK]. (If one prefers to be in Standard Mode, one must come back later and change back to that mode.)
- The next screen allows the user to enter a new word. One enters the word one wants to delete. (What one enters must be exactly the same word as on the card one wants to delete, although Serious Language Student will ignore voweling in its attempt to find the user's word.) One then hits [ENTER] or clicks on [OK].
- Serious Language Student may then show one or more cards from the original vocabulary or words that the user has added that are not to be deleted. In each such case, the user simply clicks on [NO].
- Eventually, Serious Language Student will offer the word to be deleted. Since it is a user added word, there will be a button for deleting it. One clicks on this delete button. The card will be deleted.

Note well! In order to delete the word from all records, Serious Language Student will close. Assuming the user wants to continue practicing, the program must be restarted.

## Elatives: are elatives included as separate vocabulary?

Generally, no. It is assumed that the user is familiar with the formation of the elative, e.g., from كبير, “big,” one has أَكرَرُ, “bigger.” In a few cases exceptions are made to reflect frequency, e.g., the very common word, أفضل, “better, best,” is included, whereas the corresponding, much less common adjective, فَضيل, “outstanding, first-rate, excellent,” is omitted. This also gives the user the opportunity to drill the declension of elatives.

## Gender: Can some nouns be both masculine and feminine?

Yes. For example,  روح, “author” is sometimes masculine and sometimes feminine, cf. Wehr. Where this occurs, the Serious Language Student treats the word as belonging to the unpredictable gender to alert the user to that possibility, i.e., روح here is treated as feminine. 

## Gender: Masculine and feminine markers

The Serious Language Student uses ذ for مُذَكَّر for masculine and ء for  مُءَنَّث for feminine. Note that the user needs to indicate the gender of a noun only for those very few nouns whose gender is not indicated by the form, i.e., ending in -ةٌ for feminine and masculine for all others.

## Names of Arabic Letters: How does the Serious Language Student name the Arabic letters, when using the Latin alphabet?

The Serious Language Student uses the names adopted by the Unicode Consortium, e.g., ا is called 'alef' and ع is called 'ain'.

## New Cards: How rapdidly does the Serious Language Student introduce new cards? 

The Serious Language Student introduces new cards according to a formula that is a trade secret, but which depends on the success the user is having. If the user is replying correctly to many of the words already seen, a new card is introduced sooner. If the user is not yet having complete sucess with the cards already seen, new cards are postponed.

However, the user can have some influence on how fast new cards are presented. On the Settings screen, the user should look at the response to Question 3, the number of new cards to be introduced at one time. If this number is low (the minimum allowed is 5), new cards are introduced more slowly. If this number is high (the maximum allowed is 30), new cards are introduced more rapidly.

## Nouns, collective: How does the Serious Language Student handle collective nouns?

In general only the word denoting the concept, usually masculine, is included, and the word indicating one example or one unit , usually formed by adding ة– to the masculine, is omitted. Thus ليل and ورق are included, and ليلة and ورقة are omitted as being easily deduced. Where there exists a common broken plural, it is given, and it is usually the plural of the concept, since the unit form usually has the strong plural ات -.

## Nouns in the accusative. 

Many nouns can be used as adverbs standing alone in the accusative. This construction can be part of a standard phrase. Thus from بَدَل , "substitute," one has بَدَلاً مِن , "in place of, instead of." These constructions are taken to be easily remembered, once encountered, and are not treated as separate lexical items.

## Numbers: Cardinals and ordinals. 

For the purposes of vocabulary, the Serious Language Student treats numbers simply. In particular, each word is treated as having only one form. The declension of numbers, the number and gender of a number to use, and the number of any counted thing, are left to the user's source of grammar instruction. For cardinals, the Serious Language Student gives the masculine of "one" واحِدٌ and "two" إثْتَينٌ, and the feminine of the other one digit numbers, ثَلاثَةَ , أَرْبَعَةٌ , etc. "Twenty" عِشْرونَ and "thirty" ثَلاثينَ are given as examples of multiples of ten, and "hundred" مِئَةٌ and أَلفٌ "thousand" are also included. For ordinals, "first" أَوَّلُ, "second" ثانٍ and "third ثالِثٌ are given, and the rest of the ordinals can be learned by extrapolating from those.

## Parenthetical information: Can the parenthetical part of a definition be omitted?

Yes. In fact, it is better to omit it. It is included only to give the user a better sense of the word or to distinguish the word from other words. Also, the parenthetical information is important going from English to Arabic in order to specify the Arabic word wanted. Going from Arabic to English, if users do want to include the parenthetical information in their answer, they must do so precisely as it appears, i.e., with the parentheses and with the spacing as shown on the card. 

## Particles: What is a particle?

There is a small number of Arabic words that have a primarily grammatical function and that do not lend themselves to translation by themselves. Examples which should be familiar even to beginning students of Arabic are يا, which is used in addressing someone, and هَل, which is used to mark a question. Note that most of these words are monosyllables and are among the words which Arabic grammarians refer to simply as "letters." Since these words do not have a natural translation in isolation, the Serious Language Student simply labels them "particles," and when one is going from Arabic to English, the English box can simply be filled by "particle." However, when one is translating from English to Arabic, "particle" by itself would obviousy not suffice as a prompt, and the user must pay attention to the parenthetical information to know which particle is desired, e.g., "particle (vocative)" is the prompt for يا, and "particle (interrogative)" is the prompt for هَل. When translating from Arabic to English, the parenthetical information can be, and probably should be, omitted.

## Plurals: Can a noun have no plural?

Some nouns, either in virtue of the meaning or by usage, do not have a plural, or at least do not have a plural commonly used. For example, حَمد, “praise.” Wehr is taken as the authority as to whether or not this is the case. Where a noun does not have a plural, it is presented and tested simply in its citation or dictionary form.

## Plurals: Can a noun or adjective have more than one plural?

Unfortunately for the student, an Arabic noun or adjective can have more than one plural. For example, بَحْث, “search, research,” has both بُحوث and أَبْحاث as plurals. Often there is no clear distinction in meaning. In some cases one plural is more common for smaller groups or collections and the other for larger groups or collections. In other cases, one plural is associated with one meaning of the noun, and a different plural is associated with a different meaning, e.g., ضابِط can be either "control" or "officer," but "controls" is ضَوابِط and "officers" is ضَباط . 

For reasons of space, the Serious Language Student gives and tests only one plural, and in some cases the choice is arbitrary. It will suffice for the student to know one plural initially.  Where both a sound plural and a broken plural exist, the broken plural was chosen to be presented here, since the sound plural is easily formed and recognized. 

Where an adjective can be used by itself as a noun representing human beings, comparable to the English usage of “the rich,” it will often have a sound plural. A sound plural, of course, cannot be used for the plural of things, but instead the feminine singular is used, a rule of Arabic grammar with which the student should be familiar.

## Roots: How many words are included for a given root?

As all students of Arabic understand, a given root can be the basis of a variety of words. 

For example, from ب ت ك one has:
كَتَبَ, “to write,” 
كِتاب, “book,”
كِتابَة, “a writing,”
مَكتَب, "office,” and
كاتِب, “author.” Further, as this example shows, each of the derived words can be itself a common word; here these five words are probably among the 1,000 most common words of any corpus of Arabic. 

However, once one is familiar with a root and one or two common words based on it, usually including the Form I verb, many of the other words based on that root will be easily recognized and remembered. This is especially true of words based on such patterns as مَفعَل, often “the place where one does something,” or فاعِل, often “a person who does something.” The Serious Language Student therefore includes in the first box of 1,000 cards two or rarely three of the most common words based on a given root and assumes the users will easily add to their vocabularies the remaining common words based on that root when those words are encountered.

## Shortcuts: Grammar

In order to save time, information about a word that is predictable from Arabic grammar can be omitted; the corresponding box can be left blank and the corresponding button can be left unchecked. Specifically, the following are predictable and can be omitted:

The gender of any noun ending in -ة, if the noun is feminine.

The gender of any noun not ending in -ة, if the noun is masculine.

All sound plurals, i.e., masculine plurals that simply replace ٌ  – with  ونَ -, and feminine plurals that simply replace َةٌ  -   with اتٌ -.

The feminine singular of an adjective, if it simply replaces ٌ  – with َةٌ -. (This rule and the rule above imply that for many adjectives the masculine singular and the masculine plural, if not sound, are enough. The feminine singular and plural are usually predictable.)

The third person masculine present of verbs with past vowel -i– or -u, which have present tense vowel -a– or -u– respectively, and the third person masculine singular of all derived verbs, Forms II through X. Exceptions are weak verbs, for which the third person masculine present must be given for all Forms, I through X. For the purposes of the Serious Language Student, a verb is weak if any of its root letters is  و , ء  or ي.
ْ   (sukun) may always be omitted.

Final  ٌ    (dammatan) may always be omitted.
ِ   (kesra) may be omitted under إ (alef as a hamza seat with hamza below) and before  ي  (yeh) used as a vowel.
َ   (fatha) may be omitted before  ا  (alef) and  ى   (alef maksura)و and  ُ   (damma) may be omitted before  و  (waw), when they are used as vowels.

## Shortcuts: Initial "to"

The initial "to" of all verbs may be omitted.

## Shorcuts: Keyboard versus mouse

As much as possible, Serious Language Student has tried to configure its use in order to minimize the extent to which the user must go back and forth from keyboard to mouse and mouse to keyboard. The user will have to experiment to see the extent to which this goal has been achieved. One should note the following:

- As much as possible, when a new screen opens up requiring the user's input, the cursor is already at the appropriate entry box, and the user can simply begin typing.
- If the user needs to move from one input box to another, the [TAB] key usually moves the cursor to that next box.
- If the user wants to move back to a previous box, this can often by accomplished by the Shift [TAB] key.
- On many screens, clicking on an [OK] button can be replaced by hitting [RETURN].
- The left and right arrows, [HOME], [END], [DEL] and [BACKSPACE] can be used to move the cursor, when writing Arabic, in order to edit a word that has been written. Unfortunately, the visible cursor does not appear correctly, so the user must carefully count letters to know the true location of the cursor.  The left arrow moves the cursor to the right, that is, to a spot earlier in the word, and the right arrow moves the cursor to the left. The [END] key moves the cursor to the end of the Arabic word, and the [HOME] key moves the cursor to the beginning of the word. The [DEL] key removes the letter nearer to the beginning of the word from the cursor's actual (not visible) location, and the [BACK] key deletes the letter nearer to the end of the word.

## Verbal Noun or Gerund, مَصدَر : How does the Serious Language Student treat verbal nouns?

Some lexica, e.g., Wehr, list the مَصدَر  (verbal noun or gerund) with the verb and some instructors of Arabic encourage their students to learn the مَصدَر of a verb just as they learn the present tense as part of learning that verb. The Serious Language Student, however, is driven primarily by word frequency, and sometimes a مَصدَر is far more common than the corresponding verb or far less common. For this reason the مَصدَر is included here only if it is itself a frequently used word, in which case it appears on its own card as a noun. An exception is made for the verbal nouns of derived forms, since they are predictable, and the user therefore does not need to learn them separately, e.g., the Form VIII verb اِجتَمَعَ, “to meet,” is included, but اِجتِماع, the verbal noun, which is a common word, is omitted.

Many مَصادِر have no plural, because of the nature of a verbal noun. However some  مَصادِر, especially for Type I verbs,  have no plural when they are used as verbal nouns, but have a plural when the word is used with a further, derived meaning. Example: From وَفَدَ, "to arrive," one has  وَفد, the مَصدَر, meaning  "arriving," but with the plural وُفود the word can mean "delegation" or "deputation."

## Voweling: What are the Serious Language Student's rules for voweling?

The Serious Language Student observes the following rules in providing voweling. Users who add vocabulary cards to their library must follow these rules in order for the added card to be accepted.

In general, each Arabic letter in a word must have one of the possible vowelings: fatha, fathatan, kesra, kesratan, damma, dammatan, madda, superscript alef (also called "dagger" alef) or sukun. The only exceptions involve sukun, dammatan or the so-called "semivowels," alef, yeh, waw or alef maksura. The exceptions are as follows.

Sukun is always written by the Serious Language Student, but it is always optional for the user.

Similarly, final dammatan is always written by the Serious Language Student, but it is optional for the user. The user, however, should be careful that final damma, in the case of diptotes, is not optional, and if the user omits the damma, the Serious Language Student will assume that the user intended dammatan, so the answer will be counted as not correct.

Voweling on a semivowel is omitted if the semivowel is being used as a vowel, but not if it is being used as a consonant. 

The voweling of the consonant before such a semivowel being used as a vowel may be omitted or not, as the user prefers. The Serious Language Student omits such voweling, but accepts it, if it written by the user. Thus, both في and فِي are accepted but فِيْ is not. In هِيَ both the fatha and the kesra are required; neither may be omitted. If a semivowel has a shadda, then implicitly both a consonant and a vowel are present, and it must be vowelled accordingly. These rules are illustrated by دُوَليّاتٌ . The waw is being used as a consonant with the sound /w/, and so neither the damma on the dal nor the fatha on the waw may be omitted. The Serious Language Student would accept a kesra on the lam, since it is followed by a long yeh, the first part of the yeh with shadda, but this kesra is omitted by the Serious Language Student as being unnecessary in front of the long yeh. The consonant yeh, the second part of the yeh with shadda could be given a fatha over the shadda, but since the following letter is a long alef, again the Serious Language Student omits this fatha. Finally, the final dammatan is optional for the user.

It is important for the user to know when an initial hamza is capable of eliding, i.e.,  becoming hamzatu 'l wasla. So, the Serious Language Student adopts the convention of omitting the hamza, if it can be elided in context. Thus the word for "the" is written اَل without hamza, and not أَل, but the word for "family" is written   أَهلٌ , and the hamza is required. 

Simply as a typing convenience, alef as a hamza seat with the hamza below is always pronounced /i/, so a kesra may be omitted. Thus إِ can always be written as إ , if the user wants to save a key stroke.

Note that shadda, where it is part of the word as it is pronounced, must be written and may not be assumed. Where a letter is marked by both a shadda and a vowel, the underlying programming of the Serious Language Student allows either of the two diacritics to be typed first, although to avoid any possible bugs, the user may want to acquire the habit of typing the shadda first.

## Voweling: When adding a word, when is the voweling not accepted.

The Serious Language Student rules for accepting a voweling are the following.

A single letter is never accepted.

In general, every Arabic letter must have a voweling. Excepted are alef, yeh, waw, alef maksura, alef with madda, and alef with hamzatu 'l wasla.

Also excepted are consonants followed by alef, yeh, waw or alef maksura, since in those cases the Serious Language Student assumes that the consonant is to be voweled with fatah, kesra, damma or fatah respectively.

The user may need to be particularly careful to note that sukun and dammatan may not be omitted, when the new card is created. The user may find this easy to overlook, especially over the last letter of a new word. Of course, once the new card is created, every instance of sukun and final dammatan may be omitted in future answers as always.

## Word Frequency: Are the words in the first box of the Serious Language Student’s flashcards the 1,000 most common words in Arabic?

Users need to recognize that there is no such collection of the 1,000 most common words in Arabic or in any living language. The most common words will always depend on the underlying corpus. If one takes the vocabulary of English as an example, the 1,000 most common words used in The New York Times in 2017 will not be the same set as the 1,000 most common words of every day American speech, and the latter set will vary depending on whether one is talking about informal speech among friends or more formal speech in business and work settings. For one example, “get,” meaning “to obtain” or “to become,” is probably among the 100 most common words of informal spoken American English, but well might not be used at all with those meanings in The New York Times. Also, The New York Times versus informal speech are not the only two corpora one might consider. The vocabulary of current American fiction would be yet a different corpus, as would the vocabulary of scientific journals. 

The 1,000 words chosen for the the Serious Language Student’s first box of flashcards are based on combining the results of frequency studies of a variety of different corpora. All of the studies are based on modern usage of Standard Literary Arabic. Spoken Arabic underlies the frequencies very little, except insofar as public formal speech uses the Standard Literary language. As discussed elsewhere in these FAQs, judgment is further exercised in including or excluding words on bases other than simple frequency. (See, e.g., the answer to “How many words are included for a given root?”) In any case, the 1,000 words included here are certainly among the most common words in any corpus in which a user may be planning to use Arabic and will suffice to allow the user, once these words are well learned, to read and write with some fluency.
