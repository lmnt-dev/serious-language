Unfortunately, the owner of Serious Language Student flashcards is too small to maintain a
telephone answering capacity or to respond to US Post Office mail. For the same reason,
replies cannot be promised for messages sent to the above addresses, but every attempt is
made to read and deal with all messages. Temporary edit.

Users are encouraged, after 5 to 10 business days, to consult either the New Releases Update
page, or the Serious Language Student Answers Questions page, both of which can be
accessed via the tabs above.
